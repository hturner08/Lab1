### Lab 1
**Purpose:**
The purpose of this lab was to graphically explain the sorting methods of Insertion sort,
Selection sort, Merge sort, and Quick sort. Not only can you see the sort represented
in real time with bars, but also the number of computations required for each sort.
Below is a table for the Big O notation of each sort.

Sort method | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case
Selection | O(1) | O(n) | O(n^2)
Insertion | O(n) | O(n^2) | O(n^2)
Merge | O(nlogn) | O(nlogn) | O(nlogn)
Quick | O(nlogn) | O(nlogn) | O(n^2)
